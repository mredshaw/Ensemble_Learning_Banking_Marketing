# Ensemble_Learning_Banking_Marketing
This project aims to build, evaluate, and compare ensemble models with standard machine learning models using the Term Marketing - Banking dataset. The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of each model's pros and cons and evaluate, from a business context, which model is most appropriate.
